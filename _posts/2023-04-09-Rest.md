title: "REST Book"
description: "Dusting off an old but relevant project."

Pre-COVID I was working a on pet project in my spare time.  While working at BNSF, a participated in a number of lengthy discussions and debates about REST APIs.  I realized how artistic and opinionated the design phase could be.  I ended up reading some books, blogs, and other materials to try to improve my opinions and better defend my proposals.  In the end, I realized most REST books talk about the execution of a REST API, but not all things design and security.  

I started [working on a book](https://github.com/ZacharyCalvert/restbook), which I ended up burning out on trying to balance spending time with my son, my wife, a full-time job, writing the book, and keeping up with technology.  I've toyed with picking it back up, even going back and adding some [LaTeX build pipelines](https://github.com/ZacharyCalvert/restbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yaml), but I've had some pretty positive feedback on what is there, so I can share what I have now.

Attached in the release artifacts is a [free PDF](https://github.com/ZacharyCalvert/restbook/releases/download/v0.1.0/restful.pdf).  [Let me know what you think](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachcalvert/).
